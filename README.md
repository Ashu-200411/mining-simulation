# mining-simulation
Objective:
Simulate Proof of Work (PoW) by mining a block that meets a given difficulty condition.

Features:

Enhances the Block class with a mineBlock(difficulty) method.

Mining involves:

Repeatedly incrementing a nonce.

Recalculating the hash until it meets the difficulty target (e.g. hash starts with '0000').

Prints:

Number of nonce attempts.

Time taken to mine the block.

Goal:
Experience how increasing difficulty impacts computational effort and mining time.
